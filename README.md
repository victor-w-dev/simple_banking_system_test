# simple_banking_system_test
 
## Overview
- This repository contains a simple banking system implemented in Python. It includes 3 python scripts, namely a core banking system script, a utility for reading CSV files, and a unit test suite to validate the functionality. The project simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction logging, with data persistence using CSV files.

## Features
- Users can create a new bank account with a name and starting balance
- Users can deposit money to their accounts
- Users can withdraw money from their accounts
- Users are not allowed to overdraft their accounts
- Users can transfer money to other accounts in the same banking system
- Save and load system state to CSV

## File Overview
1.[**`banking_system.py`**](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system/blob/main/banking_system.py)
  - **Purpose**: The main script that defines the `BankAccount` and `BankingSystem` classes. It handles:  
     - Account creation and management.  
     - Transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).  
     - Persistence of account details and transaction history in CSV files.  
     - Loading existing accounts and transactions on system startup.  
  - **Key Features**:  
    - Supports multiple accounts with unique IDs.  
    - Tracks balances and transactions with timestamps and reference numbers.  
    - Provides methods to view account balances and transaction histories.  
    - Example usage is included in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

2.[**`system_reader.py`**](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system/blob/main/system_reader.py)
  - **Purpose**: A utility script containing the `CSVLastRowExtractor` class, which efficiently extracts the last row of data from a CSV file using a deque. This is used by `banking_system.py` to load the latest account balances and transaction IDs.  
  - **Key Features**:  
    - Reads specific columns from the last row of a CSV file.  
    - Handles errors such as missing files or invalid columns.  
    - Lightweight and reusable for other CSV-based projects.
    
3.[**`unittest_banking_system.py`**](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system/blob/main/unittest_banking_system.py)
  - **Purpose**: A unit test suite for `banking_system.py` using Python's `unittest` framework. It ensures the banking system functions correctly.  
  - **Key Features**:  
    - Tests account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and overdraft prevention.  
    - Automatically cleans up generated CSV files after each test run.  
    - Provides feedback on test success or failure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple_banking_system_test.git
   cd simple_banking_system_test
2. No additional dependencies are requiredâ€”all scripts use Python's standard library.

### Usage

1. **Run the Banking System**  
   Execute `banking_system.py` to see the example usage:  
   ```bash
   python banking_system.py
   ```
   This will create sample accounts, perform transactions, and display the system's state.
2. **Run Unit Tests**
   Test the banking system functionality:
   ```bash
   python unittest_banking_system.py
   ```
   The script will output test results and clean up generated files.

## CSV Handling Techniques
This project uses CSV files for data persistence and retrieval in the banking system.

### Key Techniques
1. **CSV Persistence**  
   - Stores data in `system_accounts.csv`, `system_transactions.csv`, and `{account_id}_transactions.csv`.  
   - Uses consistent fields (e.g., `transaction_id`, `amount`) for parsing.

2. **Byte-Level Last Row Extraction**  
   - `CSVLastRowExtractor` in `system_reader.py` seeks to the end with `file.seek(0, 2)`, moves back to the last newline, and reads the final line.  
   - Faster for large, simple CSVs (near O(1)), parsed with `csv.reader` for latest balances and IDs.

3. **Transaction Logging**  
   - Appends transactions with metadata (e.g., timestamps) in real-time, validated as "Completed" or "Failed".

### Benefits
- Quick access to last rows in large files.  
- No external dependencies.

## CSV system file description
- [CSV system file reference link](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system_test/tree/main/program_run_sample)

- **{account_id}_transactions.csv**: Each account has a separate transactions CSV file.
  These files contain records of all transactions for the respective account.
- **System CSVs**:
  - [**`system_accounts.csv`**](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system_test/blob/main/program_run_sample/system_accounts.csv): Contains information about all accounts created in the banking system, including:
    - account_id: Unique identifier for the account.
    - user_name: Name of the account holder.
    - account_created_time: Timestamp of when the account was created.
  - [**`system_transactions.csv`**](https://github.com/victor-w-dev/simple_banking_system_test/blob/main/program_run_sample/system_transactions.csv):Contains records of all transactions across all accounts in the system, including:
    - transaction_id: Unique identifier for the transaction.
    - timestamp_start: Timestamp when the transaction started.
    - account_id: Unique identifier for the account involved in the transaction.
    - user_name: Name of the account holder.
    - type: Type of transaction (e.g., create account, deposit, withdraw, transfer).
    - amount: Amount of money involved in the transaction.
    - currency: Currency used in the transaction.
    - balance: Account balance after the transaction.
    - target_id: Target account ID for transfers (if applicable).
    - target_user_name: Name of the target account holder (if applicable).
    - reference_number: Reference number for the transaction, same reference number for a pair of 'transfer_to' and 'receive_from' transaction
    - timestamp_end: Timestamp when the transaction ended.
    - status: Status of the transaction (e.g., completed, failed).
    - remarks: Additional remarks or notes about the transaction. (always null for simulation)
    
    Note: `target_id` and `target_user_name` are only included if the transaction type is 'transfer'.
